#Educational History

\\(\textbf {October 2012 – Present},\\)                                                                     
University of Cardiff

Ph.D. in Mathematics

Title: Analytical Techniques for Partial Differential Equations on Thin Structures and their Application for the 
Design of Metamaterials.      

Supervisors: Dr K. Cherednichenko & Dr M. Cherdanstev.

The project involved the study of partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients and the 
methods used to solve them, in particular, homogenisation theory. This theory was applied to two different problems; 
the first was to the study of the governing equations of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s Equations) which led to the 
development of a set of so called homogenised relations and higher order constitutive laws. 
The second problem involved homogenisation of the governing equations for elasticity on thin structures in the so called critical scaling with a contrasting soft material inclusion.

#Funding Awarded

\\(\textbf {September 2012}\\),  
ESPRC             
Funding of approximately £14,000 a year for three and a half years was awarded to complete my Ph.D. at Cardiff 
University.

#Additional Research Experience

\\(\textbf {September 2011 – May 2012}\\)

For the final year of my undergraduate degree, I completed a project in which I researched and reviewed the origin and methods of calculus of variations. As a result of this research I was able to get a feel for academic research by means of independent study.

#Research Interests

My research has been closely related to theories relating to the solution of partial differential equations with 
rapidly oscillating coefficients via means of so called “homogenisation”. In particular, I have studied in some detail
this homogenisation theory when applied to the governing equations of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s Equations) and 
further to equations which govern elasticity of rigid bodies and thin structures. The theory when applied to 
Maxwell’s equations has led to some interesting discoveries in relation to the theory of metamaterials.

In future research, I hope to study Maxwell’s equations further and develop further the mathematical theory for 
metamaterials. In particular, I have an interest in the problem of high contrast related to Maxwell’s equations 
where it is still unclear what so called “interface” conditions are appropriate for the problem.

#Teaching Experience

\\(\textbf {October 2011 – Present}\\), 
I have aided Cardiff University consistently with, for example, taking tutorials, assisting with marking and working for the Cardiff University Maths Support scheme. This included tutoring groups of up to twenty-five students, marking undergraduate coursework, and providing relevant feedback where necessary. The work with the Maths Support scheme was most enlightening as it provided me with the constant challenge of not knowing what problem each student was going to bring through the door.

On behalf of the Maths Support scheme, I have on numerous occasions taken additional sessions for different schools in order to aid with basic numeracy. On some of these occasions, this has been a solo effort on my part.

#Conferences Attended

January 2013, "Dissipative Spectral Theory: Operator Theory, PDEs and Numerics" at Cardiff University

May 2014, "WIMCS-Gregynog" Conference. Additionally, I presented my research at this conference.

June 2014, "Mini-courses in Mathematical Analysis" in Padova University, Italy.

September 2014, "The Huxley Meeting on Analytic Number Theory" in Cardiff University.

#Courses Attended

I completed a one day course in 2011 on educating mathematics to learning mathematicians. 

LTCC course in "Dissipative Operator Theory" attended in May 2013

#Skills

Over the course of my undergraduate and postgraduate courses, I have become sufficiently familiar with the 
programming language LaTeX which allows for the quick reproduction of scientific papers, articles and lecture material.
Further to this, I am also fully competent in the majority of Microsoft packages including Word, Excel and PowerPoint.


#Additional Experience & Interests  

I pushed and organised a PhD seminar scheme at Cardiff University. This involved coordinating student availability, organising a programme as well as coordinating with the school to enusre minimal clashes with other events.

During the course of my A-levels, I helped to initiate talks with the head of mathematics to convince the school 
to allow the teaching of the Further Mathematics 'AS' Level. When I had decided that I was to undertake Mathematics 
at a university level, I then proceeded to teach myself an additional three modules as a part of the 
Further Mathematics course to earn myself the full 'A' Level.

I worked for Somerfield\The Co-operative (May 2006 – December 2013). Over the course of my employment 
I was trusted with many important tasks which have included supervisory roles in the cash office and 
managing staff.

I have a Grade 5 Distinction in Electronic Keyboard from LCM.
