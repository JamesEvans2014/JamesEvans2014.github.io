#Educational History

October 2012 – Present,                                                                     University of Cardiff

Ph.D. in Mathematics

Title: Analytical Techniques for Partial Differential Equations on Thin Structures and their Application for the 
Design of Metamaterials.      

Supervisors: Dr K. Cherednichenko & Dr M. Cherdanstev.

The project involved the study of partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients and the 
methods used to solve them, in particular, homogenisation theory. This theory was applied to two different problems; 
the first was to the study of the governing equations of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s Equations) which led to the 
development of a set of so called homogenised relations and higher order constitutive laws. 
The second problem involved homogenisation of the governing equations for elasticity when applied to a 
particular case of thin structures, namely, when the so called “critical case” is being considered in high contrast.
September 2008 – June 2012,                                                                  University of Cardiff 

MMath in Applied Mathematics, First Class Honours   

MMath Project Title: Overview of Calculus of Variations       
Modules Taken: Functional Analysis, Fluid Dynamics, Measure Theory, Groups, Rings & Fields, 
Applied Nonlinear Systems, Combinatorics, Differential Geometry and Calculus of Variations.

September 2006 – July 2008,                                                 Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy, Llanrwst, North Wales

#Funding Awarded

September 2012,  
ESPRC             
Funding of approximately £14,000 a year for three and a half years was awarded to complete my Ph.D. at Cardiff 
University.

#Additional Research Experience

September 2011 – May 2012, for the final year of my undergraduate degree, I completed a project in which I 
researched and reviewed the key points of Calculus of Variations under supervision. 
As a result of this research I was able to get a feel for academic research by means of self-study.

#Research Interests

My research has been closely related to theories relating to the solution of partial differential equations with 
rapidly oscillating coefficients via means of so called “homogenisation”. In particular, I have studied in some detail
this homogenisation theory when applied to the governing equations of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s Equations) and 
further to equations which govern elasticity of rigid bodies and thin structures. The theory when applied to 
Maxwell’s equations has led to some interesting discoveries in relation to the theory of metamaterials.

In future research, I hope to study Maxwell’s equations further and develop further the mathematical theory for 
metamaterials. In particular, I have an interest in the problem of high contrast related to Maxwell’s equations 
where it is still unclear what so called “interface” conditions are appropriate for the problem.

#Teaching Experience

October 2012 – Present, I have aided Cardiff University consistently with, for example, taking tutorials, 
assisting with marking and working for the Cardiff University Maths Support scheme. This included tutoring groups 
of up to twenty-five students, marking undergraduate coursework, and providing relevant feedback where necessary. 
The work with the Maths Support scheme was most enlightening as it provided me with the constant challenge of not 
knowing what problem each student was going to bring through the door.

#Skills:

Over the course of my undergraduate and postgraduate courses, I have become sufficiently familiar with the 
programming language LaTeX which allows for the quick reproduction of scientific papers, articles and lecture material.
Further to this, I am also fully competent in the majority of Microsoft packages including Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

#Training

I completed a one day course in educating mathematics to learning mathematicians.

#Additional Experience & Interests  

•	During the course of my A-levels, I helped to initiate talks with the head of mathematics to convince the school 
to allow the teaching of the Further Mathematics AS Level. When I had decided that I was to undertake Mathematics 
at a university level, I then proceeded to teach myself an additional three modules as a part of the 
Further Mathematics course to earn myself the full A Level.
•	I have worked for Somerfield\The Co-operative (May 2006 – December 2013). Over the course of my employment 
I have been trusted with many important tasks which have included supervisory roles in the cash office and 
managing staff.
•	I have a Grade 5 Distinction in Electronic Keyboard from LCM.

#Publications

On a full two-scale asymptotic expansion and higher-order constitutive laws in homogenisation of 
Maxwell equations (in preparation).
