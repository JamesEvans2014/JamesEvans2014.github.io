I was reading something the other day that caught my eye with relation to the Fibonacci numbers. If you're unfamiliar with the sequence construction, it goes as follows:

Let \\(F\_n\\) represent the \\(n\\)th Fibonacci number with is obtained from the sequence relation
\\[
F\_{n+2}=F\_{n+1}+F\_n,\ \ \ F\_0=1,\ F\_1=1.
\\]
