Today was the fifth time that I have aided in the tutoring of students from school of nursing at Cardiff and every time
has been an experience to say the least. There has always been varying levels of understanding but what always intrigues me is 
what is the best way to get basic numeracy across to people who have a passing knowledge of numbers, addition, multiplication, etc.
Well, with each tutoring session, I have done my best to hone this skill but at the end of the day, it comes down to the 
student's willingness to adapt and to do the problems presented themselves.

The first time I helped with this kind of tutoring, the experience was brief and I never really got the chance to sink 
my teeth in as it were. Rather, I sat back and watched the guy in charge (Rob Wilson) and observed the techniques he employed to 
try and educate the few students who turned up. Methods from introductory trigonometry was the topic of this particular session
and trying to explain the basics of "SOH,CAH,TOA". The experience was quite enlightening. Having at this point been doing 
tutorials and Math Support for a couple of years, I had some experience in getting first years maths undergraduates to
attempt problems and work towards understanding their problems as opposed to just solving them. However, the experience with these students was rather different.
These were people, with the greatest respect, who had difficulty with basic multiplication and division. This was virgin territory 
for me and it was almost difficult to hide my expressions of surprise at not being able to simplify a fraction like \\(\frac {14}{21}\\).
I realise as I write this I must sound slightly snobbish but this was genuinely intriguing for me at the time but as I say, in this instance I was merely an observer.

My first real taste of teaching elementary numeracy came some time later with the nursing school in Cardiff. There was
one goal in sight for me; can I find a way to explain these basic principles to them and such that it sticks? However, this was the least of my worries.
Little did I know that I was about to meet a problem that, at the time, was worse than useless. Medicate was a service 
developed for nurses, by nurses, to teach nurses the numeracy they required for their jobs. However, it felt like it was put together 
overnight with very little thought which led to incredible difficulties educating these nurses. This meant that we had to 
decipher the software before even attempting to explain cancelling factors. It did not help that the room spewed negativity
and that the students were on tenterhooks due to the impending numeracy exam they had.

This experience was an uphill struggle in my opinion. When we had finally gotten ahold of what Medicate was all about
we had to start trying to explain the best way to deal with the problems at hand. If you ever deal with this programme,
for three-quarters of it, you need a single formula:
\\[
\frac {\textbf {WANT}}{\textbf {GOT}}\times \textbf {IN}=\textbf {NEED}.
\\]
Effectively whether you're dealing with tablets, liquid medicines or injections, this is the formula you need. You take what you "want",
divide by what you've "got" and multiply by how much it comes "in" and, hey presto, you get what you need (said Mr Jagger!).
Getting this across was not so difficult but trying to explain the best way to deal with simplifying fractions and such 
was more of a challenge for one simple reason; there is no "best way"! What works for one student might not work for another and what a
mathematician would consider the best way almost always makes no sense to a novice and indeed will 
inevitably make them shout witchcraft! 

To surmise, this initial experience was rocky, but when I was asked to go back again, I was ready and raring. This time
I knew what to expect and I had my own ideas on how best to get these ideas across. The majority of the people in the 
room were comfortable enough to deal with their times tables even if it meant doing it out loud and so this seemed like the
best way to get to them. I took the method of writing fractions with their common factors explicitly, i.e.,
\\[
\frac {96}{120}\times 5=\frac {4\times 24}{4\times 30}\times 5=\frac {24}{30}\times 5=\text {etc.}
\\]
Some of the group opposed this method. Some found that using long division on the fraction and then multiplying by the 
number afterwards was for them, but then how do you deal with an example like
\\[ 
\frac {24}{9}\times 6.
\\]
It is obviously far too difficult to start explaining recurring decimals and how to multiply them. It then became about convincing
these people, some of whom were very set in their ways, to try different methods. In was almost mind blowing when I said
\\[
\frac {24}{9}\times 6=\frac {24\times 6}{9}.
\\]
It's something most mathematicians don't even bother to think about as it is ingrained upon us but to someone unfamiliar 
with manipulation, it's a kind of strange magic (says Mr Lynne!). Some were willing to believe this fact and use it 
to solve their problems whereas, others were less than willing. What can you do in this situation?

My session today however was special for a couple of reasons; firstly it was my first "solo mission" and secondly it was 
beign done for nurses who all seemed to want to try something new. That is, find a method that worked for them even if 
it meant leaving their comfort zone to do so. Working with exactly the same methods, exactly the same kinds of problems
and the exact same software yet with incredible results. The students in question were quite willing to learn and quite willing
to participate and try new methods to solve their problems. There was of course some resistance to this at first, that kind of "I don't like change" attitude, but quite soon after 
people were trying to simplify fractions by finding common factors and cancelling, a method that has now proven most
effective in my opinion. I always indicate that the long division method is available bu that it may not be the best course.

In conclusion, today has been one of the better tutoring sessions I've done and I hope to employ the same ideas again to see if
it truly does depend on the students willingness to adapt or maybe initially I was just new to the experience.
