This is a continuation of the discussion in the previous post found here: [Sterling Matrices Part 1](http://jamesevans2014.github.io/stirling/numbers/matrices/2014/10/25/Stirling-Matrices.html)

The inverse of the matrix \\(A\_n\\) defined in the previous post will be called the associated matrix of order \\(n\\). 
It will be denoted \\(\tilde {A}\_n\\) and its \\((i-j)\\)th entry \\(\tilde {a}\_{ij}^n\\).
