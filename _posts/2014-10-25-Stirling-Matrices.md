This is an idea that I've had floating around for a while now. The idea came about during a conference held at Cardiff University
not so long ago. The idea is simple; what are the coefficients of a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) which go through the first \\(n+1\\) prime numbers? 

Prime polynomials may have a different definition, but for the purposes of the following discussion, the definition below is what is understood.

A prime polynomial \\(p\_n(x)\\) is a polynomial of \\((n-1)\\)th order satisfying \\(p\_n(i)=p\_i\\) where \\(p\_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th prime number, \\(i=1,2,\dots , n\\).
