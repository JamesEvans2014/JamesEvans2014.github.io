This is an idea that I've had floating around for a while now. The idea came about during a conference held at Cardiff University
not so long ago. The idea is simple; what are the coefficients of a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) which go through the first \\(n+1\\) prime numbers?


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
